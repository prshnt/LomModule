Start a server in setup/before\n2. Dynamically add a route to the service with mock JSON response\n3. Run the test\n4. Shut down the server in teardown/after\n\nFairly simple, and most of all I didnt want any artifacts lying around - in other words I didn't need for any routes that I dynamically created to stick around on my local disk after the tests were done.\n\nAs such, [caddis](https://github.com/bustardcelly/caddis) was born.\n\nHow\n---\nAs mentioned briefly above, [caddis](https://github.com/bustardcelly/caddis) is a CLI tool. It is recommended to install globally:\n\n```\n$ npm install -g caddis\n```\n_: you may need to `sudo`_\n\nOnce installed, you can start the service (currently defaults to [http://localhost:3001](http://localhost:3001)) and begin POSTing route configurations in JSON. Here is an example using cUrl that dynamically adds a GET route at `/foo` with a simple JSON payload of `{\"bar\":\"baz\"}`:\n\n```\n$ curl -X POST -d '{\"method\":\"GET\", \"uri\":\"/foo\", \"response\":{\"bar\":\"baz\"}}' http://localhost:3001/api --header \"Content-Type:application/json\"\n```\n\nYou are not confiuned to cUrl - you can use whatever networking library in whatever language you are writing your tests in and the server can handle all modern RESTful methods:\n\n* GET\n* POST\n* PUT\n* DELETE\n\nWhen you are finished, simply stop the [caddis](https://github.com/bustardcelly/caddis) server:\n\n```\n$ caddis stop\n```\n\n## Post Data\nThe post body data that is sent to [caddis](https://github.com/bustardcelly/caddis) has the following properties:\n\n* __method__: The REST method\n* __uri__: The endpoint of the service to hit (requires prepended '/')\n* __response__: The JSON object to return on request\n* __statusCode__: [Optional] Status code to return. Defaults to 200\n* __delay__: [Optional] Time delay, in milliseconds, to delay response. Defaults to NaN\n\nTests\n---\n\n```\n$ npm run test\n```\n\nLicense\n---\nCopyright (c) 2014 Todd Anderson\n\nPermission is hereby granted, free of charge, to any person\nobtaining a copy of this software and associated documentation\nfiles (the \"Software\"), to deal in the Software without\nrestriction, including without limitation the rights to use,\ncopy, modify, merge, publish, distribute, sublicense, and/or sell\ncopies of the Software, and to permit persons to whom the\nSoftware is furnished to do so, subject to the following\nconditions:\n\nThe above copyright notice and this permission notice shall be\nincluded in all copies or substantial portions of the Software.\n\nTHE SOFTWARE IS PROVIDED \"AS IS\", WITHOUT WARRANTY OF ANY KIND,\nEXPRESS OR IMPLIED, INCLUDING BUT NOT LIMITED TO THE WARRANTIES\nOF MERCHANTABILITY, FITNESS FOR A PARTICULAR PURPOSE AND\nNONINFRINGEMENT.
